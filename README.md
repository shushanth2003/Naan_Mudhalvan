# Air Quality Analysis in Tamilnadu

## Project Objectives:
The project's objective was to analyze air quality in Tamil Nadu by examining historical data, with a focus on SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10 levels. We implemented data preprocessing, visualization, and linear regression modeling. Example outputs include time series plots and predictive models.
This analysis offers insights into trends, showing fluctuations in pollutant levels over time. The code aids in estimating air quality, providing valuable information for understanding and managing pollution in Tamil Nadu.

## Analysis
Analyzing air quality data in Tamil Nadu helps us understand pollution trends and levels. By looking at changes over time, variations across locations, and how pollutants interact, we can make informed decisions to improve air quality.

## Temporal Trends:
By visualizing time series data for pollutants like SO2, NO2, and RSPM/PM10, the analysis reveals how pollution levels change over time. Patterns, fluctuations, and long-term trends become apparent, aiding in understanding the impact of various factors on air quality.

## Concentrations of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
Calculates the daily average concentrations of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in Tamil Nadu. The resulting line chart provides insights into how these pollutants' levels change over time. It aids in visualizing and understanding the variations in SO2 and NO2 concentrations, essential for monitoring air quality in the region.

## Displays statistics for Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentrations
computes and displays statistics for Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentrations. It generates two box plots, one for SO2 and the other for NO2. These plots help visualize the distribution of concentration values, showing the central tendency, spread, and potential outliers in the data, aiding in the identification of extreme values and data variability.

## Data Visualization:
We used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations such as time series plots to explore pollutant trends.

## Spatial Variations:
Heatmaps and location-based visualizations show variations in pollutant levels across different monitoring stations in Tamil Nadu. This helps identify areas with consistently high or low pollution, which can inform policy decisions and resource allocation.

## Regression Modeling:
The linear regression model for estimating RSPM/PM10 levels based on SO2 and NO2 concentrations allows us to make predictions and understand how these key pollutants contribute to particulate matter in the air. This can be crucial for pollution control efforts.
Overall, the analysis enables stakeholders, policymakers, and researchers to gain a deeper understanding of air pollution trends in Tamil Nadu. This understanding can drive informed decisions and interventions to improve air quality, protect public health, and mitigate environmental impacts.
